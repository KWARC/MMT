------------------------
projects that use mmt-api and that Florian actively maintains (They should always compile.)

mmt-mizar: Mizar plugin
mmt-owl: OWL plugin
mmt-pvs: PVS plugin
mmt-specware: Specware plugin
mmt-tptp: TPTP plugin

projects that use mmt-api but that are not critical enough to be actively maintained (They might not compile anymore.)

hets-mmt: Aivaras's work for integrating with Hets, owned by DFKI but kind of died when Till and Aivaras left
latex-mmt: support for the Florian and Mihnea's LaTeX integration, should be reactivated
mmt-mathscheme: rudimentary MathScheme plugin by Florian
mmt-reflection: languages with reflection by Florian, experimental

------------------------
projects that are independent of but used by MMT, maintained by Florian

lfcatalog: Alin's support for Twelf, not MMT-related but needed by Twelf
tiscaf: a fork/freeze of tiscaf with ~3 bugs fixed, we might try to upgrade to the latest tiscaf
