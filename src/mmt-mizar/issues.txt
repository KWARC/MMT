Presumably MizPredMeansPartialDef never refers to 'it'. At least it does not for R1.
Instead of 'it <=> F', MML simply contains 'F'.
Therefore, 'it' should not be bound.

MizSchemeDef (e.g., S1) produces a formula in type position.
Maybe 'proof' is missing? Or maybe a quantifier should be a Pi instead?
