When translating all articles, I get at some point
  archive: [source -> narration] C:\other\oaff\Mizar\testmml\source\hidden.miz -> C:\other\oaff\Mizar\testmml\narration\hidden.omdoc
  error: get error: backend: no backend available that is applicable to http://latin.omdoc.org/foundations/mizar?mizar-patterns
I can't find the place that has the outdated URI mizar-patterns.
  
Presumably MizPredMeansPartialDef never refers to 'it'. At least it does not for R1.
Instead of 'it <=> F', MML simply contains 'F'.
Therefore, 'it' should not be bound.

MizSchemeDef (e.g., S1) produces a formula in type position.
Maybe 'proof' is missing? Or maybe a quantifier should be a Pi instead?
