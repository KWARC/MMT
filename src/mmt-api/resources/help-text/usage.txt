usage:
    mmt [--help|--about|--version] [--shell|--keepalive|--noshell] [--file FILENAME] [--mbt FILENAME] [--send PORT] [COMMANDS]

the MMT shell script

general arguments:
  -h, --help                show this help message and exit.
  -a, --about               print some information about MMT.
  -v, --version             alias of --about
      --usage               show usage message for specific 'make' COMMANDS
      --help-command        currently identical to --usage

commands and files to process:
  COMMANDS                  Semicolon ( ; ) separated commands to be interpreted by MMT. If a command fails, exit
                            immediately with code 2. Type "help" inside the shell for a list of commands or look at the
                            documentation for available commands.
      --send PORT           send COMMANDS to an already running MMT Instance listening at PORT and exit immediately
                            (even if a different termination behaviour is specified.)
      --file FILENAME       load mmt-style commands from FILE before interpreting COMMANDS.
                            (this option may be repeated multiple times.)
      --mbt FILENAME        load scala-style commands from FILE before interpreting COMMANDS.
                            (this option may be repeated multiple times.)

termination behaviour:

The default exit behaviour is to terminate immediately after COMMANDS have been executed. If no arguments are given to
MMT, it will start an interactive shell for the user to enter commands. The default behaviour of MMT can be overwritten
with the following arguments.

  -i, --shell               execute COMMANDS and take further commands on the MMT shell.
                            (this is the default if no arguments are provided.)
  -w, --keepalive           execute COMMANDS and terminate only after all threads have finished.
                            (no MMT shell will be started.)
  -w, --noshell             same as --keepalive (for backwards compatibility)

By default, MMT will terminate with status code 0. If parsing of arguments fails, MMT will terminate prematurely with
status code 1. If an uncaught exception occurs in the main thread, MMT will exit with status code 2.

note: for long options arguments can also be given using "=", i.e. --file=FILENAME.
