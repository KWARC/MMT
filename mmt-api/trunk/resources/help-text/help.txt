usage:
    mmt [--help|--about] [--shell|--keepalive|--noshell] [--file FILENAME] [--mbt FILENAME] [--send PORT] [COMMANDS]

the MMT shell script

general arguments:
  -h, --help                show this help message and exit.
  -a, --about               print some information about MMT.

commands and files to process:
  COMMANDS                  Semicolon (;) separated commands to be interpreted by MMT. Type "help" inside the shell to
                            a list of commands or look at the documentation for a list of available commands.
  -r, --send PORT           instead of executing COMMANDS in a new MMT instance, send them to another MMT Instance
                            listening at PORT and exit immediately (even if a different termination behaviour is
                            specified. )
  -f, --file FILENAME       In addition to running COMMANDS, load mmt-style commands from FILE. May be used multiple
                            times.
  -m, --mbt FILENAME        In addition to running COMMANDS, load scala-style commands from FILE. May be used multiple
                            times.

termination behaviour:

The default exit behaviour is to terminate immediately after COMMANDS have been executed. If no arguments are given to
MMT, it will start an interactive shell for the user to enter commands. The default behaviour of MMT can be overwritten
with the following arguments.

  -i, --shell               execute COMMANDS and take further commands on the MMT shell. Default if no arguments are
                            provided.
  -w, --keepalive           execute COMMANDS and terminate only after all threads have finished.
  -w, --noshell             same as --keepalive (for backwards compatibility)

note: for long options arguments can also be given using "=", i.e. --file=FILENAME.
